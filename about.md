Welcome! UpstArt is based in St Just in Penwith (the most westerly town in the UK). It is where I work and sell my upcycled fabric decoupage pieces. I also sell the work of other makers and [artists](artists.md) who have two things in common: firstly, they almost all use recycled materials (silver, ceramic, paper, wood, fabric, copper) or at least use etically sourced materials, and secondly I love their work.

I am a textile artist and my work evolved from traditional patchwork and quilting to more arty (landscape) quilting. From there it was a small step to glue the fabric pieces onto a canvas rather than sewing the pieces and then putting it on a canvas. I loved the way I got to play with fabric all the time, rather than only at the beginning of a project and then sewing for weeks or months to get the picture finished. Another small step and I started glueing fabric on all sort of objects: chairs, tables, vases, mirrors, clocks etc. And I love it. It transforms unwanted or superfluous objects and gives them a new lease of life. The fabrics I use are mostly from my stash which I built up over many years and from the leftovers of quilting projects. And from fabrics founds in charity shops, at auctions or car boots. And I like it that I am not adding to the waste on our planet.

The fashion is all for interiors to be neutral with walls and doors painted in pale shades of white or beige, for furniture painted white, soft grey, blue or green. But sometimes it is just something colourful like a simple chair, a table, lampshade, painting or vase that can add spice to the neutral interior and reflect your personality. So come and have a look and if you cannot find anything to your taste, talk to me and maybe I could [make you something to your specification](commissions.md)
