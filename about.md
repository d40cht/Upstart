Welcome! UpstArt based in St Just in Penwith (the most westerly town in the UK) is my studio//gallery . It is filled with exuberant upcycled furniture, amazing upcyled mirrors, clocks, mosaics, feltings on the walls and glass shelves showing off plain silver jewellery  of great beauty. The dresser is plain but colourful vintage granny blankets and hand embroidered tablecloths and artfully crocheted objects spill from its shelves….. 

Amidst all this I sit at my table and glue wonderfully colourful fabric on all sorts of inspiring objects. And I chat to customers. About the items I have picked up from a carboot, auction or charity shop and that I am transforming, about Katy’s amazing earrings that I am wearing, about Kate’s mosaics and how she is finally working again after her husband’s death two years ago, and about Rowena’s feltings and poetry, or about Inge Löök’s Aunties cards that I have loved ever since I first saw them in a shop in my native country many years ago or about my long distance walks and how, if and when you may suddenly find my shop closed, I will have gotten itchy feet and have gone off to walk Offa’s Dyke or the Pennine Way…..

If you cannot make it to St Just (you are missing much; it is a small, ex tin mining town, most houses are granite, very few trees or bushes grow here on account of the strong winds and salt spray and whatever grows in sheltered corners is mostly eaten by the most enormous bastarding slugs and snails you have ever seen. And yet, and yet…The relentless grey of the streets and the granite buildings with grey slate roofs, the wooden creosoted electricity poles with their electricity wires running overground from house to house swinging in the wind with mostly crows and starlings sitting on them….. it will grow on you. And on a fine sunny day, you will know there is no more beautiful place in the world. And there is always good food, good music and above all good shops. Like mine. But the completion isn’t half bad either. The Makers’ Emporium, Jane Adams Gallery. Kurt Jackons’s gallery, the Windswept Gallery, Bygones, Richard Guy’s Framing and Pictures to name but a few), this website might inspire you.
